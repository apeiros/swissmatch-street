Housenumber 'bis', 'ter', 'quater', 'voir ante'
  In the french part of the swiss, there are housenumbers of the form "4Bis" - this is for houses
  that do NOT have the number 4, but follow after the house with the number 4. The house does not (for
  whatever reason) have the subsequent number. Probably because it was already taken when the house
  was built.

Housenumber 'c/o'
  C/O means "care of", it is used when somebody lives in the house of somebody else, and does not
  have his name on the house sign.

Housenumber 'Postfach', 'Fach', 'PF', 'Case Postale', 'Casella Postale', 'C.P.', 'CP'
